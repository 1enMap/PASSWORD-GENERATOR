## Project Overview
This project is a scalable and efficient web application that leverages **Next.js 13+'s App Router** for server-side rendering (SSR), static generation, and routing. **React** is used for building interactive UIs, and **TypeScript** is used for adding type safety, reducing errors, and improving maintainability. **Tailwind CSS** is used for styling, making the process fast and efficient.

## Tech Stack
- **Next.js**: Framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **React**: JavaScript library for building UI components.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **PostCSS**: Tool for transforming styles with plugins.
- **ESLint**: Linter for identifying and fixing code quality issues.

## Folder Structure
- **/app**: Contains the main application pages and layouts.
  - **globals.css**: Global styles for the application.
  - **layout.tsx**: Main layout file for the app.
  - **page.tsx**: The main page file for rendering content.
- **/components**: Reusable React components.
- **/hooks**: Custom React hooks for managing state or logic.
- **/lib**: Utility functions or shared logic.
- **/node_modules**: Project dependencies.
- **.eslintrc.json**: ESLint configuration file for linting.
- **tailwind.config.ts**: Tailwind CSS configuration.
- **postcss.config.js**: PostCSS configuration file.
- **tsconfig.json**: TypeScript configuration.
- **next.config.js**: Configuration file for Next.js.
